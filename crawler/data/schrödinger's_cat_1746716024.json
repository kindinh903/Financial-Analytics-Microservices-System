            "content": "In quantum mechanics, Schrödinger's cat is a thought experiment concerning quantum superposition. In the thought experiment, a hypothetical cat in a closed box may be considered to be simultaneously both alive and dead while it is unobserved, as a result of its fate being linked to a random subatomic event that may or may not occur. This experiment, viewed this way, is described as a paradox. This thought experiment was devised by physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935 in a discussion with Albert Einstein to illustrate what Schrödinger saw as the problems of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.\nIn Schrödinger's original formulation, a cat, a flask of poison, and a radioactive source are placed in a sealed box. If an internal radiation monitor such as a Geiger counter detects radioactivity (a single atom decaying), the flask is shattered, releasing the poison, which kills the cat. If no decaying atom triggers the monitor, the cat remains alive. The Copenhagen interpretation implies that the cat is therefore simultaneously alive and dead. Yet, when one looks in the box, one sees the cat either alive or dead, not both alive and dead. This poses the question of when exactly quantum superposition ends and reality resolves into one possibility or the other.\nAlthough originally a critique on the Copenhagen interpretation, Schrödinger's seemingly paradoxical thought experiment became part of the foundation of quantum mechanics. It is often featured in theoretical discussions of the interpretations of quantum mechanics, particularly in situations involving the measurement problem. As a result, Schrödinger's cat has had enduring appeal in popular culture. The experiment is not intended to be actually performed on a cat, but rather as an easily understandable illustration of the behavior of atoms. Experiments at the atomic scale have been carried out, showing that very small objects may exist as superpositions, but superposing an object as large as a cat would pose considerable technical difficulties.\nFundamentally, the Schrödinger's cat experiment asks how long quantum superpositions last and when (or whether) they collapse. Different interpretations of the mathematics of quantum mechanics have been proposed that give different explanations for this process.\n\n\n== Origin and motivation ==\n\nSchrödinger intended his thought experiment as a discussion of the EPR article—named after its authors Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen—in 1935. The EPR article highlighted the counterintuitive nature of quantum superpositions, in which a quantum system for two particles does not separate: 150  even when the particles are detected far from their last point of contact. The EPR paper concludes with a claim that this lack of separability meant that quantum mechanics as a theory of reality was incomplete. \nSchrödinger and Einstein exchanged letters about Einstein's EPR article, in the course of which Einstein pointed out that the  state of an unstable keg of gunpowder will, after a while, contain a superposition of both exploded and unexploded states.\nTo further illustrate, Schrödinger described how one could, in principle, create a superposition in a large-scale system by making it dependent on a quantum particle that was in a superposition.  He proposed a scenario with a cat in a closed steel chamber, wherein the cat's life or death depended on the state of a radioactive atom, whether it had decayed and emitted radiation or not. According to Schrödinger, the Copenhagen interpretation implies that the cat remains both alive and dead until the state has been observed. Schrödinger did not wish to promote the idea of dead-and-live cats as a serious possibility; on the contrary, he intended the example to illustrate the absurdity of the existing view of quantum mechanics, thus employing reductio ad absurdum.\nSince Schrödinger's time, various interpretations of the mathematics of quantum mechanics have been advanced by physicists, some of which regard the \"alive and dead\" cat superposition as quite real, others do not. Intended as a critique of the Copenhagen interpretation (the prevailing orthodoxy in 1935), the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment remains a touchstone for modern interpretations of quantum mechanics and can be used to illustrate and compare their strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\n== Thought experiment ==\n\nSchrödinger wrote:\n\nOne can contrive even completely burlesque [farcical] cases. A cat is put in a steel chamber along with the following infernal device (which must be secured against direct interference by the cat): in a Geiger counter, there is a tiny amount of radioactive substance, so tiny that in the course of an hour one of the atoms will perhaps decay, but also, with equal probability, that none of them will; if it does happen, the counter tube will discharge and through a relay release a hammer that will shatter a small flask of hydrocyanic acid. If one has left this entire system to itself for an hour, one would tell oneself that the cat is still alive if no atom has decayed in the meantime. Even a single atomic decay would have poisoned it. The psi-function of the entire system would express this by having in it the living and dead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or spread out in equal parts.\n\nIt is typical of these cases that an indeterminacy originally restricted to the atomic domain turns into a sensually observable [macroscopic] indeterminacy, which can then be resolved by direct observation. This prevents us from so naïvely accepting a \"blurred model\" as representative of reality. Per se, it would not embody anything unclear or contradictory. There is a difference between a shaky or out-of-focus photograph and a snapshot of clouds and fog banks.\nSchrödinger developed his famous thought experiment in correspondence with Einstein. He suggested this 'quite ridiculous case' to illustrate his conclusion that the wave function cannot represent reality.: 153  \nThe wave function description of the complete cat system implies that the reality of the cat mixes the living and dead cat.: 154  Einstein was impressed by the ability of the thought experiment to highlight these issues. In a letter to Schrödinger dated 1950, he wrote:: 157 \n\nYou are the only contemporary physicist, besides Laue, who sees that one cannot get around the assumption of reality, if only one is honest. Most of them simply do not see what sort of risky game they are playing with reality—reality as something independent of what is experimentally established. Their interpretation is, however, refuted most elegantly by your system of radioactive atom + amplifier + charge of gun powder + cat in a box, in which the psi-function of the system contains both the cat alive and blown to bits. Nobody really doubts that the presence or absence of the cat is something independent of the act of observation.\nNote that the charge of gunpowder is not mentioned in Schrödinger's setup, which uses a Geiger counter as an amplifier and hydrocyanic poison instead of gunpowder. The gunpowder had been mentioned in Einstein's original suggestion to Schrödinger 15 years before, and Einstein carried it forward to the present discussion.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\nIn modern terms Schrodinger's hypothetical cat experiment describes the measurement problem: quantum theory describes the cat system as a combination of two possible outcomes but only one outcome is ever observed.: 57 : 1269  \nThe experiment poses the question, \"when does a quantum system stop existing as a superposition of states and become one or the other?\"  (More technically, when does the actual quantum state stop being a non-trivial linear combination of states, each of which resembles different classical states, and instead begin to have a unique classical description?) Standard microscopic quantum mechanics describes multiple possible outcomes of experiments but only one outcome is observed. The thought experiment illustrates this apparent paradox. Our intuition says that the cat cannot be in more than one state simultaneously—yet the quantum mechanical description of the thought experiment requires such a condition.\n\n\n== Interpretations ==\nSince Schrödinger's time, other interpretations of quantum mechanics have been proposed that give different answers to the questions posed by Schrödinger's cat of how long superpositions last and when (or whether) they collapse.\n\n\n=== Copenhagen interpretation ===\n\nA commonly held interpretation of quantum mechanics is the Copenhagen interpretation.  In the Copenhagen interpretation, a measurement results in only one state of a superposition. This thought experiment makes apparent the fact that this interpretation simply provides no explanation for the state of the cat while the box is closed. The wavefunction description of the system consists of a superposition of the states \"decayed nucleus/dead cat\" and \"undecayed nucleus/living cat\". Only when the box is opened and observed can we make a statement about the cat.: 157 \n\n\n=== Role of consciousness ===\n\nIn 1932, John von Neumann described in his book Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics a pattern where the radioactive source is observed by a device, which itself is observed by another device and so on. It makes no difference in the predictions of quantum theory where along this chain of causal effects the superposition collapses. This potentially infinite chain could be broken if the last device is replaced by a conscious observer. This solved the problem because it was claimed that an individual's consciousness cannot be multiple. Eugene Wigner asserted that an observer is necessary for a collapse to one or the other (e.g., either a live cat or a dead cat) of the terms on the right-hand side of a wave function. Wigner discussed the interpretation in a thought experiment known as Wigner's friend.\nWigner supposed that a friend opened the box and observed the cat without telling anyone. From Wigner's conscious perspective, the friend is now part of the wave function and has seen a live cat and seen a dead cat. To a third person's conscious perspective, Wigner himself becomes part of the wave function once Wigner learns the outcome from the friend. This could be extended indefinitely.\nA resolution of the paradox is that the triggering of the Geiger counter counts as a measurement of the state of the radioactive substance. Because a measurement has already occurred deciding the state of the cat, the subsequent observation by a human records only what has already occurred. Analysis of an actual experiment by Roger Carpenter and A. J. Anderson found that measurement alone (for example by a Geiger counter) is sufficient to collapse a quantum wave function before any human knows of the result. The apparatus indicates one of two colors depending on the outcome. The human observer sees which color is indicated, but they don't consciously know which outcome the color represents. A second human, the one who set up the apparatus, is told of the color and becomes conscious of the outcome, and the box is opened to check if the outcome matches. However, it is disputed whether merely observing the color counts as a conscious observation of the outcome.\n\n\n=== Bohr's interpretation ===\nAnalysis of the work of  Niels Bohr, one of the main scientists associated with the Copenhagen interpretation, suggests he viewed the state of the cat before the box is opened as indeterminate. The superposition itself had no physical meaning to Bohr: Schrödinger's cat would be either dead or alive long before the box is opened but the cat and box form a inseparable combination. \nBohr saw no role for a human observer.: 35 \nBohr emphasized the classical nature of measurement results.\nAn \"irreversible\" or effectively irreversible process imparts the classical behavior of \"observation\" or \"measurement\".\n\n\n=== Many-worlds interpretation ===\n\nIn 1957, Hugh Everett formulated the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, which does not single out observation as a special process. In the many-worlds interpretation, both alive and dead states of the cat persist after the box is opened, but are decoherent from each other. In other words, when the box is opened, the observer and the possibly-dead cat split into an observer looking at a box with a dead cat and an observer looking at a box with a live cat. But since the dead and alive states are decoherent, there is no communication or interaction between them.\nWhen opening the box, the observer becomes entangled with the cat, so \"observer states\" corresponding to the cat's being alive and dead are formed; each observer state is entangled, or linked, with the cat so that the observation of the cat's state and the cat's state correspond with each other.  Quantum decoherence ensures that the different outcomes have no interaction with each other. Decoherence is generally considered to prevent simultaneous observation of multiple states.\nA variant of the Schrödinger's cat experiment, known as the quantum suicide machine, has been proposed by cosmologist Max Tegmark. It examines the Schrödinger's cat experiment from the point of view of the cat, and argues that by using this approach, one may be able to distinguish between the Copenhagen interpretation and many-worlds.\n\n\n=== Ensemble interpretation ===\nThe ensemble interpretation states that superpositions are nothing but subensembles of a larger statistical ensemble. The state vector would not apply to individual cat experiments, but only to the statistics of many similarly prepared cat experiments. Proponents of this interpretation state that this makes the Schrödinger's cat paradox a trivial matter, or a non-issue.\nThis interpretation serves to discard the idea that a single physical system in quantum mechanics has a mathematical description that corresponds to it in any way.\n\n\n=== Relational interpretation ===\n\nThe relational interpretation makes no fundamental distinction between the human experimenter, the cat, and the apparatus or between animate and inanimate systems; all are quantum systems governed by the same rules of wavefunction evolution, and all may be considered \"observers\". But the relational interpretation allows that different observers can give different accounts of the same series of events, depending on the information they have about the system. The cat can be considered an observer of the apparatus; meanwhile, the experimenter can be considered another observer of the system in the box (the cat plus the apparatus). Before the box is opened, the cat, by nature of its being alive or dead, has information about the state of the apparatus (the atom has either decayed or not decayed); but the experimenter does not have information about the state of the box contents. In this way, the two observers simultaneously have different accounts of the situation: To the cat, the wavefunction of the apparatus has appeared to \"collapse\"; to the experimenter, the contents of the box appear to be in superposition. Not until the box is opened, and both observers have the same information about what happened, do both system states appear to \"collapse\" into the same definite result, a cat that is either alive or dead.\n\n\n=== Transactional interpretation ===\nIn the transactional interpretation the apparatus emits an advanced wave backward in time, which combined with the wave that the source emits forward in time, forms a standing wave. The waves are seen as physically real, and the apparatus is considered an \"observer\". In the transactional interpretation, the collapse of the wavefunction is \"atemporal\" and occurs along the whole transaction between the source and the apparatus.  The cat is never in superposition.  Rather the cat is only in one state at any particular time, regardless of when the human experimenter looks in the box. The transactional interpretation resolves this quantum paradox.\n\n\n=== Objective collapse theories ===\nAccording to objective collapse theories, superpositions are destroyed spontaneously (irrespective of external observation) when some objective physical threshold (of time, mass, temperature, irreversibility, etc.) is reached. Thus, the cat would be expected to have settled into a definite state long before the box is opened. This could loosely be phrased as \"the cat observes itself\" or \"the environment observes the cat\".\nObjective collapse theories require a modification of standard quantum mechanics to allow superpositions to be destroyed by the process of time evolution. These theories could ideally be tested by creating mesoscopic superposition states in the experiment. For instance, energy cat states has been proposed as a precise detector of the quantum gravity related energy decoherence models.\n\n\n== Applications and tests ==\n\nThe experiment as described is a purely theoretical one, and the machine proposed is not known to have been constructed. However, successful experiments involving similar principles, e.g. superpositions of relatively large (by the standards of quantum physics) objects have been performed. These experiments do not show that a cat-sized object can be superposed, but the known upper limit on \"cat states\" has been pushed upwards by them. In many cases the state is short-lived, even when cooled to near absolute zero.\n\nA \"cat state\" has been achieved with photons.\nA beryllium ion has been trapped in a superposed state.\nAn experiment involving a superconducting quantum interference device (\"SQUID\") has been linked to the theme of the thought experiment: \"The superposition state does not correspond to a billion electrons flowing one way and a billion others flowing the other way. Superconducting electrons move en masse. All the superconducting electrons in the SQUID flow both ways around the loop at once when they are in the Schrödinger's cat state.\"\nA piezoelectric \"tuning fork\" has been constructed, which can be placed into a superposition of vibrating and non vibrating states. The resonator comprises about 10 trillion atoms.\nAn experiment involving a flu virus has been proposed.\nAn experiment involving a bacterium and an electromechanical oscillator has been proposed.\nIn quantum computing the phrase \"cat state\" sometimes refers to the GHZ state, wherein several qubits are in an equal superposition of all being 0 and all being 1; e.g.,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        ψ\n        ⟩\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              2\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            (\n          \n        \n        \n          |\n        \n        00\n        …\n        0\n        ⟩\n        +\n        \n          |\n        \n        11\n        …\n        1\n        ⟩\n        \n          \n            )\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |\\psi \\rangle ={\\frac {1}{\\sqrt {2}}}{\\bigg (}|00\\ldots 0\\rangle +|11\\ldots 1\\rangle {\\bigg )}.}\n  \n\nAccording to at least one proposal, it may be possible to determine the state of the cat before observing it.\n\n\n== Extensions ==\nIn August 2020, physicists presented studies involving interpretations of quantum mechanics that are related to the Schrödinger's cat and Wigner's friend paradoxes, resulting in conclusions that challenge seemingly established assumptions about reality.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nEinstein, Albert; Podolsky, Boris; Rosen, Nathan (15 May 1935). \"Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?\".

                    "abstract": "The vibronic ground state of HO-H-OH- represents axial Ra and Sa enantiomers, with equal probabilities. It can be prepared thermodynamically at low temperatures (4K). If the chirality is measured to be Ra, then wavefunction collapse induces periodic quantum stereo-mutation from Ra to Sa to Ra to Sa and so on. Similarly, the observation of Sa induces chirality flips from Sa to Ra to Sa to Ra and so on. The period of stereo-mutation is τ = 2.554 ps. The phenomenon is supported by the low energy barrier 174.6 hc cm-1 between the enantiomers and by the light masses of the hydrogen atoms, which interchange positions during stereo-mutation. Interchanges of heavier atoms and higher energy barriers would prohibit Schrödinger cat ground states. This is demonstrated for the counter example, isotopically substituted 12CDH13CH2-Si-12C13C. The results are obtained by means of quantum chemical calculations and quantum dynamics simulations. A protein kinase (EC 2.7.1.37) which phosphorylates histones was purified partially from the soluble fractions of cultured plant cells. The optimum pH was 7.5 to 9.0. The activity wasnot stimulated by exogeneous cyclic AMP. It was thermolabile and completely dependent on the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ for activity. p-Chloromercuribenzoate inactivated this enzyme and this inactivation was overcome by mercaptoethanol. High-voltage paper electrophoresis of small samples of serum and urine at pH 6.0 resolves basic and acidic amino acids and separates them from the neutral amino acids. For separation and identification of the neutral amino acids, the appropriate area of the electrophoretogram is cut out, sewn onto a second sheet of paper, and rerun at pH 1.9. By this method, amino acids are rapidly resolved. It is suited for use with special procedures such as oxidation of biological fluid with performic acid and specific staining for confirmation of amino acid identification.",

                    "abstract": "The observation of quantum phenomena often necessitates sufficiently pure states, a requirement that can be challenging to achieve. In this study, our goal is to prepare a nonclassical state originating from a mixed state, using dynamics that preserve the initial low purity of the state. We generate a quantum superposition of displaced thermal states within a microwave cavity using only unitary interactions with a transmon qubit. We measure the Wigner functions of these \"hot\" Schrödinger cat states for an initial purity as low as 0.06. This corresponds to a cavity mode temperature of up to 1.8 kelvin, 60 times hotter than the cavity's physical environment. Our realization of highly mixed quantum superposition states could be implemented with other continuous-variable systems, e.g., nanomechanical oscillators, for which ground-state cooling remains challenging. This work describes a rapid method for the production of a biotin-deficiency in mice. Besides classical morphological symptoms, a decrease of activities of some biotin-dependent enzymes was also observed. The biotin-enzymes are not inhibited at the same extent in a same organ and the metabolic changes do not always follow the enzymatic modifications. Sodium butyrate produces reversible changes in morphology, growth rate, and enzyme activities of several mammalian cell types in culture. Some of these changes are similar to those produced by agents which increase the intracellular level of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) or by analogs of cAMP. Sodium butyrate increases the intracellular level of cAMP by about two fold in neuroblastoma cells; therefore, some of the effects of sodium butyrate on these cells may in part be mediated by cAMP. Sodium butyrate appears to have properties of a good chemotherapeutic agent for neuroblastoma tumors because the treatment of neuroblastoma cells in culture causes cell death and \"differentiation\"; however, it is either innocuous or produces reversible morphological and biochemical alterations in other cell types.",

                    "abstract": "Consciousness, at its simplest, represents awareness of self in relation to the outside world. This can be divided further into the reasoning and rationality of Access consciousness (A-C) versus the experiential and 'what it's like' of Phenomenal consciousness (P-C). A-C is directly measurable, using standard tests of cognition and memory. However, owing to the subjective nature of P-C, its direct testability remains problematic. We have previously derived indirect measures of P-C that incorporates a combination of subjective questions that are informed by objective dimensions of A-C. This battery of questions have shown sound proof of principle but have not yet been fully tested in the clinical space. As a bridge to clinical validation and in the challenge of a quantification gap, a thought experiment (TE) provides supporting evidence from the philosophy of science. We propose testing the foundational principles upon which operationalization of P-C questions has been designed through the prism of such a TE. We identified that a late-stage theory confirmation type of TE was appropriate for context. In the absence of suitable candidate TEs from cognitive science, we explored adaptation of a classical thought experiment from quantum physics. The 'Schrödinger's cat' TE was refined for purpose into a novel 'Schrödinger's cat and mouse' TE. Using this novel TE, our stated theories on consciousness, specifically P-C, and means of testing resonate with disorders of consciousness, not least delirium. A temperature-sensitive mutation in Escherichia coli K-12 was shown to affect acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase and to map at min 63. This site is designated fabE. The apparent solubility of hexamethylmelamine in aqueous solutions suitable for intravenous use was increased by complexation with gentisic acid. Studies were carried out in the pH 0-8 range. Unprotonated hexamethylmelamine did not form complexes with the gentisate ion, while the hexamethylmelammonium ion appeared to form several different complexes with both the gentidate ion and gentisic acid. Two different solid complexes were isolated and characterized. The solubility increases observed at pH 3.5-5.0 are described by mathematical relationships involving the stability constants of some postulated complex species. From these results, sultable formulations for use as parenteral solutions are proposed. The increase in the apparent aqueous solubility of hexamethylmelamine in such formulations may range from five- to 90-fold, depending upon the pH and total gentisateion concentrations.",

                    "abstract": "In quantum information processing, two primary research directions have emerged: one based on discrete variables (DV) and the other on the structure of quantum states in a continuous-variable (CV) space. Integrating these two approaches could unlock new potentials, overcoming their respective limitations. Here, we show that such a DV-CV hybrid approach, applied to superconducting Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs), enables us to entangle a pair of Schrödinger's cat states by two methods. The first involves the entanglement-preserving conversion between Bell states in the Fock-state basis (DV encoding) and those in the cat-state basis (CV encoding). The second method implements a   gate between two cat states following the procedure for Fock-state encoding. This simple and fast gate operation completes a universal quantum gate set in a KPO system. Our work offers powerful applications of DV-CV hybridization and marks a first step toward developing a multi-qubit platform based on planar KPO systems. Fifty one patients from different surgical units, hence anesthetized by different anaesthesists, underwent reinterventions in abdominal surgery. The indications for the first intervention essentially involved the supra-mesocolic region of the abdomen (62 out of 100 cases). The operative risk during the first intervention was on the average 18 pour cent. The protocol of the first anaesthesia which was known in 42 cases, was of the narco-ataralgestic type. The date of the return to the operation table varied from 1 to 60 days. The state of the patients was in general catastrophic (organic renal failure, acute respiratory failure). Here again the anaesthesia was of the narco-ataralgesic type but the choice of drugs varied depending on the patients' state. However non significant difference was noted in the average hourly drug consumption between the two interventions. Apart from one circulatory arrest during induction, in one patient with hemorrhagic shock, no death was attributable to the anesthetic technique. The authors, using these findings, attempt to pick out a practical line of behaviour. By isoelectric focussing the lyzing complex produced by Actinomyces griseinus-11 has been fractionated. The sole neutral protease which is active at pH 7.0 does not participate in lysis induced by other enzymes. The lyzing activity of this complex is associated with the carbohydrase enzymes that are at least three in number. Various carbohydrases may exert a synergistic effect upon their combined action on the protein-vitamin concentrate.",

                    "abstract": "In recent years, the interest of consumers in fruit juice extracts as nutraceuticals has increased. Fruits, especially red berries, contain valuable bioactive compounds such as polyphenols. Polyphenols are often associated with anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anti-cancer, cardioprotective and gastroprotective properties. However, the relationship between the various effects of fruit juice extracts and their influence on the permeability of the intestinal barrier, as well as their influence on glucose transport across the intestinal membrane, is not known. Therefore, in the present study, anthocyanins and copigments were obtained from 11 fruit juice extracts by XAD7 column chromatography and characterized their health-promoting effects, as well as their influence on the intestinal membrane. Chokeberry, pomegranate and blueberry extracts showed the highest antioxidant activity, but showed incomplete regeneration of the intestinal membrane upon treatment-induced higher permeability. This may depended on the high anthocyanin level of these extracts. Treatments with gojiberry extract, elderberry extract and the copigment fraction of apple achieved the best suitable regeneration of the intestinal barrier. The transcription of epithelial glucose transporters GLUT1 und GLUT2 as well as for the oxidative stress genes catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were most effectively reduced by chokeberry extract. To sum up, fruit juice extracts possess high antioxidant potentials and can reduce the expression of antioxidant enzymes and glucose transporters in colon cells. While the glucose uptake may be reduced, the intestinal permeability is increased, which varies due to the extract composition. Therefore, fruit juice extracts need to be fractionated and characterized in more detail to identify the health-beneficial compounds. Resuscitation of these patients during operation is the only the logical continuation of their preparation. The authors therefore take up the preceding points while emphasizing: - checking vascular filling, by central venous pressure and hourly diuresis; - the necessity for a supply of carbohydrates, which is even more indispensable when the subjects were submitted to parenteral hyperalimentation previously; - the advantages of performing arterial blood gases in order to check artificial ventilation.",

Here we show that a Schrödinger cat has a well defined value of a property that is complementary to its “being dead or alive” property. Then, thanks to complementarity, it has an undefined value of the property “being dead or alive”. In other words, the cat paradox is explained through quantum complementarity: of its many complementary properties, any quantum system, such as a cat, can have a well defined value only of one at a time. Schrödinger’s cat has a definite value of a property which is complementary to “being dead or alive”, so it is neither dead nor alive. Figuratively one can say it is both dead and alive. While this interpretation only uses textbook concepts (the Copenhagen interpretation), apparently it has never explicitly appeared in the literature.

The latter (proven within the quantum formalism) states that two observers, agents within the QBism terminology, performing joint measurements of the same observable A on a system S in the state $$\\psi $$ ψ should get the same outcome $$A=x.$$ A = x . In Ozawa’s terminology, this outcome is intersubjective and it can’t be treated as personal. This is the strong objection to QBism which can’t survive without updating its principles. The essential aspect in understanding of the OIT-impact on QBism’s foundations takes the notion of quantum observable. This paper comprises the complementary discussion highlighting the difference between the accurate, von Neumann, and inaccurate, noisy, quantum observables which are represented by PVMs and POVMs respectively.

What is moral knowledge, why is it important, and how can it be achieved? What can it contribute to establishing a moral doctrine and to responding to meta-ethical questions?

Another source of energy for enzyme catalysis is the borrowing of energy from the environment allowed by the uncertainty principle. Commutators, symmetry, and “group theory” are introduced. The “harmonic oscillator” is revisited in terms of creation and annihilation operators, which are important in their own right and also as a tool to understand the interaction of light with matter. Rotational symmetry and angular momentum are shown to be intimately related.",

The data set of the flat universe model is generated for four different cases of separation constant $$B$$ with step size $$0.1$$ by Mathematica and imported into LMB-NNs for training, testing, and validation of the our proposed technique. The performance of LMB-NNs is provided by the validation of mean square error, error histogram, and regression analysis.

In Nature, however, finite quantum systems describing real materials clearly exhibit such effects. In this paper we discuss these apparently “paradoxical” phenomena and outline various ideas and mechanisms that encompass both theory and reality, from physical and mathematical points of view.",

Although treating the measuring apparatus as a classical system has been a successful approach in explaining quantum phenomena, it raises fundamental questions about the nature of measurement and the validity of wave function collapse. In this paper, we discuss a thought experiment that explores superposition in the measuring apparatus when it is treated as a quantum system. The experiment uses the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect in a two-photon interference setup, and its outcome is indicated by the coincidence count. Specifically, a zero count implies the existence of superposition, while a non-zero count indicates a wave function collapse. The discussions provide insight into the measurement problem, particularly regarding wave function collapse and nested measurement, and highlight the importance of indistinguishability to it. It provides a framework that probes the exact conditions necessary for a wave function collapse to happen.",

The cat is never in superposition. Reduction of the Schrödinger s cat to a simple quantum circuit. In quantum mechanics Schrödinger s cat is a thought experiment concerning quantum superposition. Interpretations Since Schrödinger s time other interpretations of quantum mechanics have been proposed that give different answers to the questions posed by Schrödinger s cat of how long superpositions last and when or whether they collapse. Fundamentally the Schrödinger s cat experiment asks how long quantum superpositions last and when or whether they collapse. The Present Situation in Quantum Mechanics A Translation of Schrödinger s Cat Paradox Paper . According to Schrödinger the Copenhagen interpretation implies that the cat remains both alive and dead until the state has been observed. As a result Schrödinger s cat has had enduring appeal in popular culture. The superposition itself had no physical meaning to Bohr Schrödinger s cat would be either dead or alive long before the box is opened but the cat and box form a inseparable combination. It examines the Schrödinger s cat experiment from the point of view of the cat and argues that by using this approach one may be able to distinguish between the Copenhagen interpretation and many worlds. Schrödinger s Cat Sixty Symbols a video published by the University of Nottingham. When opening the box the observer becomes entangled with the cat so observer states corresponding to the cat s being alive and dead are formed each observer state is entangled or linked with the cat so that the observation of the cat s state and the cat s state correspond with each other. 153 The wave function description of the complete cat system implies that the reality of the cat mixes the living and dead cat. All the superconducting electrons in the SQUID flow both ways around the loop at once when they are in the Schrödinger s cat state. The Schrödinger s cat TE was refined for purpose into a novel Schrödinger s cat and mouse TE. Applying this no go result to the Schrödinger s cat paradox implies that if something is claimed to be a real Schrödinger s cat there will be no measurable difference between it and a trivial classical mixture of ordinary cats in any physically implementable process unless raising the dead becomes reality."
